        content: "This is played on small courts using soft red balls. This allows players to rally and play matches at a young age. The red balls used help young players develop techniques that will serve them well moving from a small to a big court. The coaching at Barnes Tennis Academy focuses on making tennis fun and keeping players active, as we believe enjoyment is key to maintaining enthusiasm for the sport. Alongside enjoyment, learning is the other main academy principle.",
